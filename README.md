# User Configuration Manager

A lightweight Python-based tool designed to manage user settings using dictionaries. This project was developed as part of a **freeCodeCamp (FCC)** certification challenge.

## 🚀 Features
* **Add Setting**: Add new configuration pairs with key-existence validation.
* **Update Setting**: Modify existing settings while ensuring data integrity.
* **Delete Setting**: Remove specific settings from the dictionary.
* **View Settings**: Display all current settings in a clean, formatted list.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
* **Case Sensitivity**: Automatically handles input by converting keys and values to lowercase.
* **Formatted Output**: Uses string manipulation (`.capitalize()`) and specific punctuation to meet strict system requirements.
* **Dictionary Logic**: Implements core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using Python dictionaries.

## 📝 How to Use
1. Clone this repository or download `user_configuration_manager.py`.
2. Import the functions into your Python script.
3. Pass a dictionary and the required data (keys/pairs) to the functions.

## 🎓 Learning Objectives
This project demonstrates proficiency in:
* Python dictionary methods (`.items()`, `del`, `in`).
* String formatting and exact punctuation matching.
* Writing clean, commented code for better maintainability.
